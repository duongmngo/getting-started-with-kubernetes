This is a noteworthy occasion for an open-source project like WordPress and one well worth celebrating. To mark the occasion, <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">WordPress communities across the world gathered</a> for parties and meetups in honor of the milestone.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, there were 224 events globally, with <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/about/\">a few more of those still scheduled</a> to take place in some communities — attend one in your area if you can.</p>\n\n<p>If your city doesn’t have a WordPress meetup group, this is a great opportunity to start one! Learn how with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/\">the Meetup Organizer Handbook</a>, and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Privacy Tools added to WordPress core</h2>\n\n<p>In light of recent changes to data privacy regulations in the EU, WordPress Core shipped important updates <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-4-9-6-privacy-and-maintenance-release/\">in the v4.9.6 release</a>, giving site owners tools to help them comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is worth noting, however, that WordPress cannot ensure you are compliant — this is still a site owner’s responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The new privacy tools include a number of features focused on providing privacy and personal data management to all site users — asking commenters for explicit consent to store their details in a cookie, providing site owners with an easy way to publish a Privacy Policy, and providing data export and erasure tools to all site users that can be extended by plugins to allow the handling of data that they introduce.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more about these features and the other updates, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/17/4-9-6-update-guide/\">4.9.6 update guide</a>. You can also get involved in contributing to this part of WordPress Core by jumping into the #core-privacy channel in the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and following<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\"> the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Updates to the WordPress.org Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, WordPress.org itself has received <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">an updated Privacy Policy</a> to make clear what is being tracked and how your data is handled. Along with that, a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/cookies/\">Cookie Policy</a> has also been added to explain just what is collected and stored in your browser when using the site.</p>\n\n<p>These policies cover all sites on the WordPress.org network — including WordPress.org, WordPress.net, WordCamp.org, BuddyPress.org, bbPress.org, and other related domains and subdomains. It’s important to note that this does not mean that anything has changed in terms of data storage; rather that these documents clarify what data is stored and how it is handled.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>WordCamp US 2018 has <a href=\"https://2018.us.wordcamp.org/2018/05/29/speak-at-wordcamp-us/\">opened up speaker submissions</a> for the December event.</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2018/05/15/wceu-live-stream-tickets/\">Live stream tickets are now available for WordCamp Europe</a>, happening on June 14-16.</li>\n	<li>Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress Core, is getting ever closer to the final stages with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/05/18/whats-new-in-gutenberg-18th-may/\">a major update</a> this month.</li>\n	<li>In preparation for Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/43309\">significant work has been done</a> to improve WordPress Core’s build process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"6065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"WordPress.org Privacy Policy Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/05/wordpress-org-privacy-policy-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 25 May 2018 08:06:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"privacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:325:\"The WordPress.org privacy policy has been updated, hurray!

The Community Team has been hard at work helping communities around the world plan local anniversary parties.</p>\n\n<p>Check <a href=\"https://wp15.wordpress.net/\">the central anniversary website</a> to see if there’s already a party being planned near you. These parties are all organized by local communities — if there’s no local community in your area, you can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/welcome/#starting-a-new-meetup-com-group\">start one today</a> and host a party yourself.</p>\n\n<h2>Work has Started on a Gutenberg Migration Guide</h2>\n\n<p>With Gutenberg, the upcoming WordPress content editor, in rapid development, a lot of people have been wondering how they will convert their existing plugins to work with the new features. To mitigate the issues here and help people overcome any migration hurdles, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/04/26/your-help-wanted-gutenberg-migration-guide/\">a Gutenberg Migration Guide is underway</a> to assist developers with making their code Gutenberg-compatible.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to contribute to this guide, you can review <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide\">the existing documentation on GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbachhuber/gutenberg-migration-guide/issues\">open a new issue</a> if you find something to add.</p>\n\n<h2>Theme Review Team Launches Trusted Authors Program</h2>\n\n<p>Reviews of themes submitted to the Theme Directory can take quite a while to complete. In order to combat this issue and to make the theme submission process smoother for everyone, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2018/04/30/trusted-authors-program/\">the Theme Review Team is introducing a Trusted Authors Program</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This program will allow frequent and reliable theme authors to apply for trusted status, allowing them to upload themes more frequently and to have their themes automatically approved. This will allow more high-quality themes to be added to the directory, as well as recognize the hard work that authors put in to build their themes.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to get involved with reviewing themes, you can read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">their getting started guide</a>, follow the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">team blog</a> and join the #themereview channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/04/wordpress-4-9-5-security-and-maintenance-release/\">WordPress 4.9.5 was released</a> early this month, fixing numerous bugs and potential security issues.

The GDPR Compliance team is looking for help to test the privacy tools that are currently being developed in core. </p>\n\n<h2>What is GDPR?</h2>\n\n<p>GDPR stands for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">General Data Protection Regulation</a> and is intended to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union. Its primary aim is to give control back to the EU residents over their personal data. <br /></p>\n\n<p>Why the urgency? Although the GDPR was introduced two years ago, it becomes  enforceable starting May 25, 2018.</p>\n\n<h2>Make WordPress GDPR Compliance Team</h2>\n\n<p>Currently, the GDPR Compliance Team understands that helping WordPress-based sites become compliant is a large and ongoing task. The team is focusing on creating a comprehensive core policy, plugin guidelines, privacy tools and documentation. All of this requires your help.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The GDPR Compliance Team is focusing on four main areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Add functionality to assist site owners in creating comprehensive privacy policies for their websites.</li>\n    <li>Create guidelines for plugins to become GDPR ready.</li>\n    <li>Add administration tools to facilitate compliance and encourage user privacy in general.</li>\n    <li>Add documentation to educate site owners on privacy, the main GDPR compliance requirements, and on how to use the new privacy tools.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Don’t we already have a privacy policy?</h2>\n\n<p>Yes and no. That said, The GDPR puts tighter guidelines and restrictions. Though we have many plugins that create privacy pages, we need means to generate a unified, comprehensive privacy policy. We will need tools for users to easily come into compliance.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Site owners will be able to create GDPR compliant privacy policy in three steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>Adding a dedicated page for the policy.<br /></li>\n    <li>Adding privacy information from plugins.</li>\n    <li>Reviewing and publishing the policy.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A new &#8220;postbox&#8221; will be added to the Edit Page screen when editing the policy. All plugins that collect or store user data will be able to add privacy information there. In addition it will alert the site owners when any privacy information changes after a plugin is activated, deactivated, or updated.<br /></p>\n\n<p>There is a new functionality to confirm user requests by email address. It is intended for site owners to be able to verify requests from users for displaying, downloading, or anonymizing of personal data.<br /></p>\n\n<p>A new &#8220;Privacy&#8221; page is added under the &#8220;Tools&#8221; menu. It will display new, confirmed requests from users, as well as already fulfilled requests. It will also contain the tools for exporting and anonymizing of personal data and for requesting email confirmation to avoid abuse attempts.<br /></p>\n\n<p>New section on privacy will be added to the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/\">Plugin Handbook</a>. It will contain some general information on user privacy, what a plugin should do to be compliant, and also tips and examples on how to use the new privacy related functionality in WordPress.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The new privacy tools are scheduled for release at the end of April or beginning of May 2018.</p>\n\n<h2>How can you get involved?</h2>\n\n<p>We would love to have your help. The first step is awareness and education.

More than 800 others joined via livestream for a total audience of nearly 3,000 participants. A <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2018-contributor-day-posts-record-turnout-amid-wi-fi-outage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">record-setting Contributor Day</a> kicked off the event, followed by two days of conference sessions and workshops from 65 speakers.</p>\n<p>A team of 54 organizers and 170 volunteers made WCEU possible, with 10 different organizing teams. Last year WordCamp Europe added a PR team and this year the event introduced an Attendee Services team to fill gaps in the organization. The operation ran smoothly, despite the conference being spread out across many rooms in the sprawling <a href=\"http://www.savacentar.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sava Centar</a> venue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.wp-europe.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe&#8217;s PWA</a> (progressive web app) was the highlight of the new features and services introduced this year. It was a central hub for keeping attendees informed on what was happening at any given moment. Organizers also added new amenities, including a site health check station, Community Room, and info booth to handle attendee questions.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg and Progressive web apps were the hot topics of this year&#8217;s WordCamp Europe. In addition to Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-unveils-gutenberg-roadmap-at-wceu-wordpress-agencies-and-product-developers-sprint-to-prepare\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unveiling a roadmap for Gutenberg&#8217;s inclusion in core</a>, a strong contingent of designers and engineers from the team were present to educate attendees on Gutenberg&#8217;s architecture and the vision behind the project.</p>\n<p>Many attendees were visiting Serbia for the first time and Belgrade delivered with its renowned hospitality and captivating nightlife. Attendees found no shortage of delicious options for food and drink.</p>\n<h3>Berlin to Host WordCamp Europe 2019</h3>\n<p>At the conclusion of the event, organizers announced Berlin as the next host city for <a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe, June 20-22, 2019</a>. The conference, Contributor Day, and the after party will all be held at the <a href=\"https://www.estrel.com/en/home.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Estrel Hotel and Congress Center</a>, a venue with a capacity for 12,000 attendees.</p>\n<p>Organizers said that Berlin&#8217;s accessibility, reasonable prices, and strong community were the final deciding factors for its selection as the next host city.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Behind the Scenes at WordCamp Europe 2018 with Lead Organizers Jenny Beaumont and Milan Ivanović</h3>\n<p>Hosting a volunteer-led event at this scale requires an enormous amount of effort from the organizers, especially those taking the lead for multiple years in a row. There is nearly no down time as the team is already planning for the next edition of the camp.</p>\n<p>I sat down with lead organizers Jenny Beaumont, the global lead, and Milan Ivanović, the local lead, to get a look behind the scenes at what is involved in bringing WordCamp Europe to thousands of WordPress enthusiasts in one weekend. We <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2018-to-be-held-in-belgrade-serbia-june-14-16\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a> them at the conclusion of WCEU 2017 in Paris. Over the past two years these leaders have developed a strong working relationship built on encouraging each other and keeping a positive outlook for their teams.</p>\n<p>Beaumont said she was hesitant going into a third year for this role, as Paris was the project that captured her heart and motivation. After going through this event as the global lead, she said she discovered what she could bring to the role and how she could serve the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The event has been their project,&#8221; Beaumont said. &#8220;My project this year has been the team, how I can really concentrate on this team, on its growth, on its health, on its sustainability. That&#8217;s what I learned in Paris &#8211; the importance of making sure that was part of the project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Beaumont and Ivanović explained the difference between the global and local lead roles, a structure that works well for flagship WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The local team is really about making it a good experience in this new place that everybody is going to be discovering for the first time,&#8221; Beaumont said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the hard work, it&#8217;s the logistics, it&#8217;s all of the small details, everything that&#8217;s behind the scenes that make it so you walk in as an attendee and it just feels like you&#8217;re at home. They do all of that hard work. The global role, as it has evolved, is really about being that sort of team care-giver, making sure that there is good communication happening, making sure the team is healthy and happy and motivated. Because you&#8217;ve got to get up and do this every day while you&#8217;re also doing your day job, and that takes a lot.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe had a strong impact on the local community with more than 400 Serbian attendees and 20 Serbian organizers. They worked to build awareness of WordPress in the local community ahead of the event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We used this event to grow our community and used our community to promote the event,&#8221; Ivanović said. &#8220;When we announced last year in Paris that Belgrade is going to be next, at that time we had five or six cities for WordPress meetups. Currently, we are in 14 cities and starting the 15th in July. WordCamp Europe and the conference itself was such a win for the whole community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ivanović will return next year as the global lead for WCEU in Berlin. Beaumont is taking some time off after three years organizing WordCamp Paris and WordCamp Europe, but she hopes to return in some capacity in the future. They are working together with their team to publish a WordCamp Europe handbook that covers some of the important specifics of the event for upcoming teams.

The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/atomic-blocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atomic Blocks</a> theme is now available on WordPress.org with minimal styling and seamless support for all core content and media blocks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/atomic-blocks-screenshot.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The theme allows users to control the width of the content area to create full-screen posts and pages. It supports full-screen images, videos, and galleries, showcasing the new editor&#8217;s wide alignment styles for content. Atomic Blocks includes Customizer options for uploading a logo, customizing the font style, setting body and title font sizes, and selecting an accent color.</p>\n<p>Check out the theme&#8217;s demo to see the blocks in action: <a href=\"https://preview.arraythemes.com/atomicblocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://preview.arraythemes.com/atomicblocks</a>.</p>\n<p>The theme also seamlessly supports McAlister&#8217;s new Atomic Blocks project, a collection of page-building blocks included in the accompanying <a href=\"https://atomicblocks.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Atomic Blocks plugin</a>. It currently includes blocks for creating a post grid, call-to-action, testimonials, inline notices, sharing icons, author profiles, accordions, customizable buttons, drop caps, and spacer/dividers, with many more blocks planned.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/testimonials-block.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew Gutenberg was going to be a game changer from the second I saw it and started hashing out product ideas in October 2017,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;To me, it felt like a very natural evolution and transition for WordPress into a more forward-thinking content creator. All of the tools outside of WordPress are evolving and becoming better and easier to use and WordPress is starting to feel quite dated in comparison.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McAlister said his team is building Atomic Blocks into a full-fledged content block solution that will include a commercial version in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a long list of blocks that we’ll be releasing into the plugin in the coming months — everything from eCommerce to email marketing to full-page layouts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There will definitely be a commercial version of the plugin for those extra awesome blocks that will take your site to the next level.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McAlister is keeping Atomic Blocks separate from Array Themes but plans to cross promote between the two. He also plans to update the Array themes collection to support the blocks found in the plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Atomic Blocks aims to solve a different problem in a different way than the traditional WordPress themes you’ll find on Array,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;By launching it separately from Array Themes, it gave me the opportunity to diversify my projects a bit and create a dedicated marketing stream for a Gutenberg solution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many products in the Array Themes catalog are already working with the new editor, but McAlister and his team intend to provide more in-depth support for specific Gutenberg features in themes where appropriate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’ve stayed fiercely committed to beautiful design, simplicity, and core coding standards and practices to ensure wide-spread support and compatibility with our themes,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;While this has served us well, we are all ready for a core-supported solution to providing a better experience for our customers. Gutenberg will solve this problem by providing a cohesive, unified way of extending content creation with a core user interface. Gutenberg is quite extensible as is, and will only grow more capable with time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McAlister said one of the most challenging aspects of launching Atomic Blocks has been keeping pace with Gutenberg&#8217;s rapid development, requiring the team to follow multiple conversations across various WordPress core development discussion channels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I followed Gutenberg development closely during the second half of last year and then started developing Atomic Blocks for Gutenberg early this year,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;You have to follow the Github repo, Make blog posts, and Slack conversations closely to keep up with the changes, deprecations, and feature additions. Luckily, now that features are being frozen, the code is churning less and things are starting to stabilize.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to keep up with all the news and changes, McAlister started the <a href=\"http://gutenberg.news/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg News</a> site to collect helpful resources, tutorials, and code snippets he found. The site contains more than 200 links to resources for both beginners and developers.</p>\n<p>McAlister predicts that Gutenberg will bring a greater separation between the roles of themes and plugins in the site-building experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The demand for themes will certainly begin to change more drastically in the long term,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Traditional WordPress themes will still be desirable for a number of years, simply due to the number of sites out there and the solutions needed to build them. Eventually, much of what can be provided by a theme will be provided by blocks via a plugin instead. Themes will still be responsible for providing a degree of styling and functionality that will remain critical to the site-building experience, but they will take a secondary role to content blocks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg will inevitably change the landscape of the theme industry, but McAlister sees it as a chance to reach customers in a new way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Theme designers and developers should be excited about this opportunity and not feel threatened by Gutenberg,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;This is a fantastic opportunity to learn a new set of skills, attract a new segment of customers, and start pivoting to a block-based product model.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 22:33:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 323 – Recap of WordCamp Grand Rapids and A Gutenberg Road Map\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=82285&preview=true&preview_id=82285\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-323-recap-of-wordcamp-grand-rapids-and-a-gutenberg-road-map\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2142:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> recaps his trip to WordCamp Grand Rapids and shares his experience.

The gateway was previously available as a beta plugin and could be enabled on a per-site basis but is now available to all WordCamps.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/04/03/moving-wordcamp-ticket-sales-from-paypal-to-stripe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposing Stripe as the default payment gateway</a> in April, Hugh Lashbrooke cited the fact that PayPal is entirely blocked and inaccessible in some countries. He also identified Stripe&#8217;s simpler UI and larger number of supported currencies as its chief advantages.</p>\n<p>PayPal has been the default for years on WordCamp websites but it currently supports only 26 currencies. Stripe supports 136 currencies, allowing WordCamp organizers to offer ticket purchases in more places than before. Previously, some communities were forced to build a local gateway integration to sell WordCamp tickets via PayPal, requiring those sales to be inconveniently funneled through a local bank account. The Stripe gateway option is a welcome update to support WordPress&#8217; growing international community, which held camps in 73 countries in 2017.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Stripe isn&#8217;t fully replacing PayPal. The Camptix plugin allows organizers to activate multiple payment gateways for cases where one or both make more sense, retaining the flexibility to support ticket sales at camps with different payment requirements.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 18:02:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"HeroPress: Translating For Love\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2587\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://heropress.com/translating-for-love/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=translating-for-love\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3006:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/092816-vladimir_petkov-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I started translating WordPress so that my seven-year-old daughter can share her personal stories.\" /><p>We all have our reasons for the things we do.

Core design contributors are currently working on a few new iterations of the callout. They are also considering including a section inside the prompt with an option to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin in preparation for Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>Developers and agencies have time to install the Classic Editor on client sites that are not ready for Gutenberg, but this will not prevent users from seeing the &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; prompt. <a href=\"https://gschoppe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Greg Schoppe</a>, one of Gutenberg&#8217;s most outspoken critics, partnered with <a href=\"https://so-wp.com/plugin/classic-editor-addon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pieter Bos</a> to develop a plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor-addon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor Addon</a> that changes how the Classic Editor plugin works.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For agencies supporting many sites, whose users have no way of knowing whether Gutenberg will break their site or not, this nag screen is a danger,&#8221; Schoppe commented on our most recent Gutenberg update. &#8220;Pre-emptively installing Classic Editor unfortunately won’t suppress the nag notice either, but since Classic Editor is being used as a bellwether of the success of Gutenberg, it’s important that you install it, if you expect issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schoppe co-wrote the Classic Editor Addon to solve this problem. It suppresses the &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; prompt and when the new editing experience ships in 5.0, it will automatically suppress Gutenberg as well.</p>\n<p>Since the Classic Editor plugin doesn&#8217;t remove Gutenberg by default, the addon plugin sets the option to fully replace Gutenberg. It also removes the Classic Editor&#8217;s options from the Settings > Writing screen. Schoppe said he believes this is what the Classic Editor plugin should have done out of the box, instead of requiring the user to find the settings screen to replace Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>Installing both the Classic Editor and Classic Editor Addon on tens or hundreds of client sites could be time consuming, so Schoppe suggests using a site management dashboard, such as MainWP, ManageWP, or Jetpack, to bulk install both plugins for clients.</p>\n<p>According to stats on WordPress.org, Gutenberg is active on more than 10,000 sites and the Classic Editor is active on 4,000+ sites. The &#8220;Try Gutenberg&#8221; prompt is expected to go out in WordPress 4.9.8, which is targeted for the end of July. The goal for the prompt is to make users aware of the plugin and get more testers involved before Gutenberg lands in WordPress 5.0.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 22:35:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"Post Status: Working on your own website — Draft Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=46462\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://poststatus.com/working-on-your-own-website-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1619:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

The catastrophic event, referred to in Japan as the Great East Japan Earthquake, devastated the region&#8217;s infrastructure and took more than 15,000 lives. It also caused a level 7 meltdown at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex.</p>\n<p>Until this point Nukaga had only used WordPress as a blogging tool, but her hometown prefecture needed a fast way to get a website up for publishing accurate measurements of the radiation levels. Although she was living in Osaka at the time, Nukaga joined the volunteer team and built the site using WordPress. In addition to local radiation levels, it also had FAQ&#8217;s about radiation from scientists to combat the misinformation that was rampant at the time. People found the site through social networks and word of mouth.</p>\n<p>After making a difference for her hometown with WordPress, Nukaga wanted to find out more about the community behind the software. She joined an offline <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/ja-JP/WordBench/?_cookie-check=ng_FrFUqDlEMFkbN\">WordBench</a> meetup and got connected to the WordPress community. The next year she co-organized WordCamp Osaka 2012, and in 2014 she became the lead organizer of WordCamp Kansai, an area that includes seven prefectures: Mie, Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, Wakayama.</p>\n<p>As Nukaga became more deeply involved in the WordPress community as a speaker, organizer, and contributor, she developed a new understanding of the power of open source collaboration. After moving to the remote island of Ogijima in 2014, she was inspired to create a library and cultural center, using WordPress to organize a team of more than 200 volunteers.</p>\n<p>“When my family and I moved to this island, the school here was closed, because there were no kids on Ogijima,” Nukaga said. “We have a daughter, so we urged the government to reopen the school.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Although the school restarted, I thought that it would be meaningless for the school to stop or close again when our daughter graduated. The island is an aging society and no new children will be born here. I figured that if there was a library, I could call migrants to the island. A library which is free and an open space would help solve many things, such as children’s learning environment, communication support for the islanders, and migration consultation, for example.”</p>\n<p>Nukaga set up a WordPress website before constructing the library so her team of volunteers could disclose the progress of the building and recruit followers. They promoted the website through social networks and were able to crowdfund efforts to construct and maintain the building.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ogijima-library.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ogijima-library.or.jp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ogijima Library</a> opened in February 2014 as a non-profit organization that is rooted in the community, providing a place where people can connect through books and share knowledge with one another. Residents on the island now have access to titles and periodicals that would previously have required a boat trip to acquire. More than 50 migrants have moved to the island within the last four years since the library opened, including families with babies born last year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Without WordPress, none of this would have been possible,&#8221; Nukaga said.  “WordPress opened my way. It taught me the philosophy of open source. I have used this philosophy to involve many unspecified people from the beginning of the process of making the library. We built the building ourselves with the help of 200 volunteers, and we continue to get support through book donations. Also, thanks to the flexibility of WordPress, the things I wanted to do, such as updating, providing a search system for books, and linking to social networks, were all possible.”</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Ogijima: “Empowering the Smalls to Go Big”</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community on the island is also thriving, thanks to community organizers who call Ogijima home. Nukaga organizes the meetups, which average 5 to 20 attendees at each event. <a href=\"https://ogi.osampo-radio.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shinichi Nishikawa</a>, who organized WordCamp Tokyo in 2012 and helped build a new WordPress community in Bangkok, made his home on the island in March 2016. He is joining forces with Nukaga and a team of 35 leaders and volunteers to organize the first <a href=\"https://2018.ogijima.wordcamp.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Ogijima</a> on July 15, 2018.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wc-ogijima.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This will be the first Japanese WordCamp not held in the cities. Organizers have chartered two ferries to transport more than 250 attendees to the island. Camping is the primary lodging option in tents beside the island’s lighthouse and organizers have planned a BBQ after party. Although the event is currently sold out, 10 additional <a href=\"https://2018.ogijima.wordcamp.org/2018/05/20/registration-information-en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tickets</a> will go on sale on July 10 due to cancellations and an estimation of no-shows.</p>\n<p>“The uniqueness of the community in this area is that there are many with different backgrounds,” Shinichi Nishikawa said. “WordCamps in the city are mainly attended by engineers, designers and bloggers, but here there are people who are restaurant managers, farmers, a barber, an illustrator, a ranger (nature protection officer), baker, and others who are interested in WordPress.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wcogijima-organizers.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The organizing team, which includes many new contributors from all walks of life, along with meetup organizers in the Setouchi inland sea area, has adopted the theme “Empowering the smalls to go big.”</p>\n<p>Ogijima’s local community includes members like Kaisho Damonte, who is using WordPress and WooCommerce to power <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/feed\">a website for the bakery and cafe business he started</a> after renovating a 100-year-old barn on the island. Kentaro Yamaguchi, another island resident, uses WordPress for his <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/feed\">barber shop’s website</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screely-1531150922541.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Nishikawa said he sees WordCamp Ogijima as “a WordCamp in a new place, for new audiences, by new organizers.&#8221; He appreciates the openness of the islanders who are willing to embrace new things.</p>\n<p>“The WordPress community on the island represents this atmosphere,” Nishikawa said. “Everyone has their own views, plans for their lives, and their own ways of thinking. WordPress, with its ‘Democratization of Publishing’ mission is a great match to us, who are trying to make our lives in different ways. We have built a library, cafe, a barbershop, and offices DIY ourselves.  When it comes to websites, WordPress helps us a lot.”</p>\n<h3>The WordPress Community in Ogijima is Defined by a Focus on Cooperative Learning</h3>\n<p>One of the most inspirational aspects of the community in Ogijima, along with the greater Japanese WordPress community, is the strong emphasis on helping each other learn and succeed. New members are often woven into the community through meetups that focus on connecting around specific interests outside of WordPress technical skill. The community warmly welcomes users who are new to WordPress who want to get help with their websites. Nishikawa said this is the particular audience that the Ogijima meetup is trying to reach.</p>\n<p>“We want to connect with individuals who want to achieve something; small business owners, designers, photographers, writers, editors, and anyone who is struggling doing something on the web,” Nishikawa said. “By coming together, you notice that there are many friends who are struggling as well. Experienced developers attend as usual but their role this time is to share their knowledge to the new people. We help each other build and improve our websites. It&#8217;s a very relaxed and helping atmosphere in the meetups. We do have some presentations sometimes but that&#8217;s not the main thing.”</p>\n<p>WordPress Core Committer <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mikeschroder/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Schroder</a> will be speaking at WordCamp Ogijima about how everyone has something unique to bring to the community to help it grow.</p>\n<p>“I initially visited Japan for WordCamp Tokyo a few years ago — largely because it was the biggest WordCamp in the world at the time,” Schroder said. “The community in Japan is extremely active and welcoming, and I quickly made many friends. One unique part of the community is that it has a big focus on education. The <a href=\"http://wordbench.org\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordBench</a> events are excellent!”</p>\n<p>“As the theme of the event is ‘Empower the smalls to go big,’ I’m looking forward to sharing some bits of my background, and how others have helped me grow, in an effort to show folks that they have a lot to offer,” Schroder said. (He’s also doing a bit of research and is interested to hear stories from others about unique aspects of their lives that have helped them succeed in the WordPress ecosystem.

Bobich said he built the app in 10 days to explore the possibilities of React and the WP REST API.</p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s still a work in progress, the app has a <a href=\"http://justwrite.app\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a> where curious testers can manage posts from any WordPress website that&#8217;s secured with HTTPS and has the JWT Authentication plugin installed. Alternatively, testers can click on the &#8220;play in the sandbox&#8221; to bypass authentication.</p>\n<p>Once logged in, the user sees a dashboard with the most recent posts, a deliberate design decision that Bobich made to &#8220;motivate the user to do one thing &#8211; to just write.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/just-write-dashboard.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The editor includes support for Markdown and a simple preview with a sticky toolbar at the top. Just Write also allows the user to edit their profile and personal information in a dropdown at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-03-at-4.17.02-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Bobich said he created to the app to improve his JavaScript skills and doesn&#8217;t have a plan to use it for business.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ever since we were all told a couple of years ago, &#8216;Learn JavaScript deeply,&#8217; I’ve seen just how many holes I had in my own JavaScript knowledge,&#8221; Bobich said. &#8220;I’ve been working hard the last couple of years to become more than just a jQuery monkey. And so this project is just another step towards my personal growth surrounding the technologies involved here. It’s so exciting to think about the potential things that we can build in the community with React and the WordPress API.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WP REST API Currently Poses Complicated Hurdles for App Developers</h3>\n<p>After the REST API was merged into core, the time seemed ripe for developers to build a proliferation of different writing experiences for users. However, working with the API still has many hurdles for application developers, limitations that Bobich said he became acquainted with while developing Just Write.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For anyone wanting to build a practical application like this, the first glaring issue is around authentication,&#8221; Bobich said. &#8220;WordPress has no way to securely authenticate from outside of the WordPress admin. So expecting any average user to set up oAuth or JWT with a third-party plugin is a bit of a reach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bobich also encountered issues working with media and saving content the WordPress way (which allows shortcodes to get parsed before <code>wpautop()</code>). The application is not yet ready for real, practical use but would require even more API calls to do things like get ahold of categories and tags or add the ability to create new ones.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Think about all the work WordPress has put into the way we embed media in different ways,&#8221; Bobich said. &#8220;Just having basic things we take for granted — pasting a YouTube link, a tweet, uploading an image and having it cropped 100 ways ’til Sunday — for all  work properly would all take custom JavaScript coding.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bobich said he thinks these limitations are the reason why there aren&#8217;t yet more applications built with decoupled editing experiences. Yet, in the new era of Gutenberg, Just Write&#8217;s alternative writing interface offers a simplicity that some users may prefer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As the WordPress admin continues to grow and become more complex, some people get excited and others moan and grown,&#8221; Bobich said. &#8220;But building something like Just Write shows us that there’s more to WordPress than just what we see. There’s more than a menu full of plugins and a new editor built in React that we may or may not like. WordPress can be what we want. It can fit our own needs or any client’s. And this all comes from the potential ability to decouple the editing experience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As WordPress has evolved to accommodate different user types from blogging, websites, and niche applications, Bobich said he thinks the next logical step is for developers to begin creating admin interfaces catered specifically to users&#8217; individual needs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg marks an important turn in the evolution,&#8221; Bobich said. &#8220;For those that were clinging to the simplicity of WordPress and blocking out some of the other noise, this might not be something they end up liking&#8230; or maybe it will?</p>\n<p>&#8220;But the bigger point is that what we see there in the admin doesn’t have to be it. I hope people will be braver than me and really set out to build these different alternatives. If I can polish my React skills and build that myself in 10 days, I can only imagine what others can do.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Jul 2018 18:09:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.9.7 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6091\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/07/wordpress-4-9-7-security-and-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3983:\"<p>WordPress 4.9.7 is now available.

Home wifi would have cost $45 a month. The cable company wanted a $100 deposit to create my account. It wasn&#8217;t going to happen, I could get wifi with a cup of coffee for $3 (including the tip) at a coffee shop a few blocks away from my place that meant I got some semblance of being social. I couldn&#8217;t imagine giving up 15 days a month at coffee shops just so it was easier to work from home, not when I could get away with sitting on my porch poaching wifi from my neighbors when I got stuck and had to google regular expressions for the 400th time. Or, my favorite, sit in a park down the street where there were three unprotected wifi networks and a strong tree to lean against.</p>\n<p>My path to becoming a web developer started when I packed up my beat up Chevy Prizm and drove to Portland, Oregon. I had graduated college with degrees in Economics and Political Science. While there, I become a Linux user when I discovered that it used less space meaning I had more space for music. I had never written code, but when my friends and I decided we wanted to create our version of The Onion, I started searching. After a little bit of trial ( blogger ) and error ( blogger ), I found WordPress and it&#8217;s &#8220;Famous Five Minute Install&#8221;. I purchased a domain and hosting from a place that advertised heavily and set about creating our site.</p>\n<p>The public library was my initial source of information. After all, having fun isn&#8217;t hard when you&#8217;ve got a library card. I picked up books on CSS, PHP, Java, Database design, and anything I could get my hands on. I was working evenings as an usher for the Portland Trailblazers and would head over to a 24 hour coffee shop to cowboy code under fluorescent lights until I was ready to crash.</p>\n<hr class=\"ttfmake-hr\" />\n<p>I can think of three big breaks that really helped move me along. Each of these ended up being &#8220;Flash Forward&#8221; moments where I was able to grow.</p>\n<h3>My First Client</h3>\n<p>I was scouring craigslist looking for anything I could get my hands on when I found someone offering $25 to move their WordPress site from one domain to another. Having just done that, I sent an email and crossed my fingers. Somehow, my eagerness (and likely willingness to work for peanuts) got my their trust. I had my first client. It took me way longer than I would have hoped as I learned about things like DNS Propagation, but I completed the task. And did such a good job that I was asked if I could build a website for one of their friends who was a standup comic. I was honest that I had never built a real site from scratch, but they liked how I had communicated, so I got the gig.</p>\n<h3>My First Core Experience</h3>\n<p>Before the first time I contributed to WordPress, I went to the Portland WordPress User Group to ask if something I was seeing was possibly an issue that warranted emailing the wp-hackers mailing list. I was so scared of being wrong that I felt like I needed to ask permission. I assumed that I was going to make a fool of myself and be laughed at. I ended up <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-June/026386.html\">emailing the list</a> and it turned out, I had found a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10022\">spot where WordPress could be better</a>! In the grand scheme of WordPress, passing a parameter to three `do_action` calls didn&#8217;t help WordPress gain 1% of market share, but it did help me with the plugin I was working on. And I was exposed to the process. I learned about trac, and the weekly devchat, and patches and svn. While I didn&#8217;t get props, I still consider this my first contribution to WordPress Core.</p>\n<h3>My first WordCamp</h3>\n<p>WordCamps are cheap compared to most tech conferences, but when you are playing the game of &#8220;How do I eat on $10 a week&#8221; for months on end, $40 for a conference whose value is unknown is a hard sell. Luckily, the Portland WordPress User Group did a raffle for a ticket and I won. All I had to pay for was the $2 in bus fare each way and I had the chance to learn. The 2009 WordCamp Portland ended up being where Matt Mullenweg announced that WPMU was going to be merged into core in WordPress 3.0 and it&#8217;s where I saw a talk entitled &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2009/09/20/will-norris-building-plugins-portland09/\">How Not to Build a WordPress Plugin</a>&#8221; by Will Norris. Will&#8217;s talk exposed me to WordPress development in a way that I would never have imagined on my own. It helped me level up from someone who mostly was copy and pasting PHP to someone who was writing code.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I was able to network for the first time. It no longer was the same 15 people who went to the meetup, it was now about 200 WordPress fanatics, many who wanted to hire someone like me to work on their website!</p>\n<p>Looking back, these flash forward moments contributed almost as much to luck to my success. In many ways, a lot of my success can be attributed to the luck of being born as someone who is essentially a white cis-male into a family where I was exposed to computers and had a chance to gain a solid liberal arts education.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just that luck that helped me. I had to provide good customer service to turn a $25 task into a contract to build my first website. I had to be willing to embarrass myself by asking what I thought was a dumb question. I had to show up and become a part of my local community to get a ticket for a conference where I learned and networked.</p>\n<p>Soon after WordCamp Portland 2009, I had enough client work coming in that it made sense to have wifi. Home wifi meant I could start being connected to the WordPress community more than once a month in person or a few hours here and there at coffee shops. It meant I could read dev chat every week and eventually it meant I could earn props. Networking at meetups, WordCamps and conferences led to full time jobs. Taking risks and being willing to look like a fool in front of the WordPress community have enabled me to become a WordPress Core committer (and sometimes continue to look like a fool). In addition to volunteering on WordPress Core, I&#8217;m now the Director of Editorial Technology for Penske Media Corporation where I help brands like Rolling Stone and Variety run on WordPress, but I&#8217;ll never forget when if I needed to code, I was going to sit under trees in parks or the fluorescent lights of a 24 hour coffee shop.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Coding under trees and in 24 hour coffee shops\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Coding%20under%20trees%20and%20in%2024%20hour%20coffee%20shops&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcoding-under-trees-and-in-24-hour-coffee-shops%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Coding under trees and in 24 hour coffee shops\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcoding-under-trees-and-in-24-hour-coffee-shops%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcoding-under-trees-and-in-24-hour-coffee-shops%2F&title=Coding+under+trees+and+in+24+hour+coffee+shops\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Coding under trees and in 24 hour coffee shops\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/coding-under-trees-and-in-24-hour-coffee-shops/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/070418-150x150.jpg&description=Coding under trees and in 24 hour coffee shops\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Coding under trees and in 24 hour coffee shops\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/coding-under-trees-and-in-24-hour-coffee-shops/\" title=\"Coding under trees and in 24 hour coffee shops\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/coding-under-trees-and-in-24-hour-coffee-shops/\">Coding under trees and in 24 hour coffee shops</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Jul 2018 18:30:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Aaron Jorbin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Incubator Program 2018 to Host Events in Montevideo, Uruguay and Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=82134\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-to-host-events-in-montevideo-uruguay-and-kota-kinabalu-malaysia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2465:\"<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/montevideo.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>The Pocitos neighborhood of Montevideo, Uruguay.

The program provides a jump start for new WordPress communities where meetups have not yet been well-established. Montevideo and Kota Kinabalu were selected from a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2018/05/15/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-update/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">short list of 14 communities</a> that had been whittled down from 104 applications for the program.</p>\n<p>WordPress Community Deputies will co-lead the events and mentor a local team that will organize a one-track WordCamp with approximately 50-75 attendees. The goal is to empower the new organizers and the fledgling communities to host more local events, ideally regular meetups and an annual WordCamp. Mentors will assist in finding speakers and sponsors. A global sponsorship grant will cover 100% of the events&#8217; costs, relieving the organizers of the burden of local fundraising.</p>\n<p>WordPress Community Team member Rocío Valdivia announced the program&#8217;s new cities for 2018 and said she anticipates the events will happen in the last quarter of this year. Local co-leads have been charged with starting a monthly meetup group before setting a date for the new WordCamps.</p>\n<p>Round 2 of the WordCamp Incubator Program follows up a successful run in 2016 that brought WordCamps to Denpasar, Harare, and Medellín. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/harare-and-nairobi-host-2nd-round-of-successful-wordcamps\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Harare hosted its second WordCamp in 2017</a> and a <a href=\"https://2018.harare.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2018 camp</a> is in the early planning stages. This particular African community, along with the neighboring Nairobi community (on the short list in 2016), are strong examples of how the incubator program can provide a boost in areas of the world where the WordPress community is not yet deeply rooted.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 03 Jul 2018 03:41:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: Block Unit Test Plugin Helps WordPress Theme Developers Prepare for Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=81919\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/block-unit-test-plugin-helps-wordpress-theme-developers-prepare-for-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4606:\"<p><a href=\"https://themebeans.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ThemeBeans</a> founder Rich Tabor has released a new plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-unit-test/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Block Unit Test for Gutenberg</a> that helps theme authors test their themes for Gutenberg-readiness. It is similar to the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Theme Unit Test</a> but is limited to testing Gutenberg blocks.</p>\n<p>After installing and activating both Gutenberg and sBlock Unit Test, the plugin creates a new page as a draft with an example of every core Gutenblock. This makes it easy to see how the blocks will appear on the frontend of any theme. Block Unit Test also includes variations on the core blocks with different alignment and column settings applied.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/screely-1530556922797.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Tabor said he knew it would be advantageous to start using/writing in Gutenberg daily to better understand what he needed to do to make his products at ThemeBeans compatible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I added initial support for Gutenberg in my Tabor WordPress theme, as I use it on my own personal blog with Gutenberg,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I needed a way to easily test each of the core Gutenberg blocks (and eventually third-party blocks) without having to manually add them every time I wanted to test something. As Gutenberg blocks get more dynamic and complicated, it’s a bit trickier to test for &#8211; as many blocks have different variations/styles/columns/grids/etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor took inspiration from the Theme Unit Test and created Block Unit Test with Gutenblock variations included. He is using the plugin while preparing the 20+ themes in his ThemeBeans catalog to support Gutenberg. He wrote the plugin to be extensible and made it open source on <a href=\"https://github.com/thatplugincompany/block-unit-test\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> for other developers and theme shops to use.</p>\n<p>Theme developers can install Block Unit Test as a first step towards making sure the front-end styles match the editor styles. This will be essential to making the transition process easier for new Gutenberg users once WordPress 5.0 ships. Tabor also published a tutorial for <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/add-wordpress-theme-styles-to-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adding WordPress Theme Styles to Gutenberg</a> to help others get started.</p>\n<p>In getting his first theme compatible, Tabor said he relied heavily on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg Handbook</a>, as well as following discussions on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s not terribly difficult to add support for Gutenberg, although applying proper theme styles within the Gutenberg editor is a bit of task — there’s so much that can be accidentally overlooked,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;For the theme side of things, there wasn&#8217;t much technical leveling-up — though developing blocks is a different story. I did need to raise the bar and dive deeply into the world of Javascript, though looking at the block examples on the GitHub repository really helped me along.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor said he started &#8220;living and breathing all things Gutenberg&#8221; after WordCamp US 2017, and began writing development articles while learning the ropes. He created several projects focused on the new editor, including <a href=\"https://writy.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Writy</a>, a Gutenberg-centric writing experience for publishers, and <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/coblocks/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Co-Blocks</a>, a beta suite of Gutenberg blocks for content marketers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a founder of a theme shop it was apparent that I needed to hone in on Gutenberg and level-up my knowledge, technical skills, and consequently my products, in order to compete in a post-Gutenberg era of WordPress,&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe the foundation of the future of WordPress lies in the success of Gutenberg. I use the new editor just about daily now. I know it’s a great move in the right direction and I’m doing my part to make sure folks using my themes can experience everything that Gutenberg has to offer.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 02 Jul 2018 21:43:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: June 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6087\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4626:\"<p>With one of the two flagship WordCamp events taking place this month, as well as some important WordPress project announcements, there’s no shortage of news.

During the event I had the opportunity to set up a panel with four experts who are working to integrate progressive web development practices more deeply in WordPress core, plugins, and themes. These practices make it possible for a website (or app) to work offline, load quickly, deliver content on unreliable networks, and use device-specific features to provide a better experience for the user. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-introduces-official-mobile-app-new-tech-for-on-site-badge-printing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PWA (progressive web app) created for WordCamp Europe</a> is a good example of this in action.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TweetyThierry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thierry Muller</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iAlbMedina\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alberto Medina</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westonruter\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Weston Ruter</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a> joined me for an interview, exploring the future of WordPress themes in the era of progressive web development. (see video below)</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the most abstract level, it&#8217;s all about user experience,&#8221; Medina said. &#8220;How do we maximize the pleasure that our users get when they use our websites? And delightfulness in this context means things like performance, speed, having content that isn&#8217;t blocked. If you think about themes built according to those principles, then we are basically seeking an awesome user experience in WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear what this will look like for the WordPress theme landscape, as current solutions are somewhat fragmented. WordPress contributors are working to standardize progressive technologies in core so the ecosystem can collaborate better together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are many progressive themes being built these days,&#8221; Medina said. &#8220;One of the problems that is happening is that there is a lot of fragmentation. There&#8217;s a lot of plugins that are using service workers but in their own ways. What we want is to say, &#8216;This is the best way to do things,&#8217; this is a uniform API to do it, and then enable progressive theme developers to take advantage of the core functionality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Currently, the prospect of setting up a WordPress site that uses progressive web technologies would be a daunting task for regular users, even if they are implementing existing solutions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s also a user aspect of it, because the people for whom we design WordPress, plugins, and themes, are the people who actually publish their own content onto the web,&#8221; Rand-Hendriksen said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a really valid question in how much should they need to know about how the web works to be able to publish some content. When they spin up a WordPress site, should we impose on them to know that they need to add all these optimization plugins and do all this other stuff just to make the site work properly? How much of that can be offloaded onto the theme itself, or plugins, or even WordPress core?&#8221;</p>\n<p>The members of the panel are working together to on various projects and core contributions that will standardize the use of progressive enhancement technologies in WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal is to have a common API for service workers so that plugins and themes can each install their own logic, just like they can enqueue their own scripts today,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;Also to be able to enqueue their own service workers and then core can manage the combination of them, as well as having a common app manifest that plugins and themes can collaborate on and have a single output into the page.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is how Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wprig.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Rig starter theme</a> project came about &#8211; to help developers take advantage of these best practices in the meantime, without having to figure out how to put all the pieces together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Rig gives you the platform to build a progressive theme that uses all the latest performance and WordPress best practices, in a convenient package, and over time it will evolve with these new progressive technologies,&#8221; Rand-Hendriksen said.</p>\n<p>We also discussed AMP and Gutenberg compatibility, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43328\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">core support for web app manifests</a>, and how the commercial theme industry will react to these new technologies.

He currently has a proof of concept for adding content from Google Docs and will add more depending on contributions from others and his availability to work on the plugin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 22:52:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"Matt: Automattic’s First New Board Member: General Ann Dunwoody\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48215\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://ma.tt/2018/06/automattics-first-new-board-member-general-ann-dunwoody/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8216:\"<img />\n\n<p>As Automattic keeps growing we’ve been bringing in a lot of talented people behind the scenes to help expand on our vision as we go from hundreds to thousands of colleagues, and hundreds of millions to billions in revenue. Recently, former New York Times digital executive Kinsey Wilson joined our team as <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/news/one-time-npr-and-nyt-digital-chief-new-adventure-wordpress\">president of WordPress.com</a>, the Chief Design Officer of Axios <a href=\"http://www.alexislloyd.com/\">Alexis Lloyd</a> has joined <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexislloyd/status/1006882661040877568?lang=en\">as head of Design Innovation</a>, the former CEO of Bluehost James Grierson is leading <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a> partnerships, and today I&#8217;m excited to announce a change to my bosses, the board of directors.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Gen. Ann Dunwoody served for 37 years in the U.S. Army, and she is the first woman in U.S. Military history to achieve a four-star officer rank. She’s also the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0738217794\"><em>A Higher Standard: Leadership Strategies from America&#8217;s First Female Four-Star General</em></a>, a book I really loved and highly recommend. Automattic&#8217;s board has had no new members since its founding in 2005, so this is our first addition in 13 years. I became familiar with General Dunwoody&#8217;s work while researching distributed organizations outside of technology, which led me to the military, which led me to geek out on logistics, which led me to her book and eventually flying out to Florida to meet in person.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Below is a brief interview with Gen. Dunwoody &#8212; we chatted with her about global leadership, finding your passion, and building a business. <br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>We&#8217;re excited to have you onboard, General Dunwoody. It&#8217;s interesting &#8212; at Automattic we like to point out that we&#8217;re all over the globe (over 740 employees in more than 60 countries) but you oversaw 69,000 military and civilians across 140 countries! Were there any big leadership lessons from managing operations across such a wide range of distances, timezones, and cultures? </strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>That’s a great question. When I started out as a young officer in the Army, the leadership philosophy that was espoused back then was “Leadership by walking around.” When you&#8217;re in charge of a platoon, a company or even a battalion or Brigade that is not globally dispersed this philosophy is very sound. When you’re running a global organization with 69,000 folks in 140 countries, you have to leverage technology to keep real-time communications flowing and keep leaders updated. I would host (with the leadership) a global video teleconference every Wednesday connecting every organization from Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Europe, etc. and sites &#8212; hundreds across the United States. Our headquarters  would provide an operational update and then we go around the globe to get update from from everyone &#8212; what&#8217;s going well, where they need help or additional resources. In the old days I think people believed information was power and often withheld information to use for personal advantage, but I believe shared information is power. By leveraging the power of the entire industrial base we could solve problems in real time. I still travelled around a lot to see our people, but it is not possible to keep everyone informed and in the loop with current operations without leveraging technology. <br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>I love your answer about &#8220;shared information is power.&#8221; Did you ever find it difficult to break down the silos and embrace that concept? </strong></p>\n\n<p>Oh my, yes. They weren’t just silos, they were silos with concertina wire around them!   Parochialism was rampant and everyone wanted their own system and own their own information. We had over 200 stand alone systems that didn’t talk to each other. So to field and design an enterprise IT system that leveraged systems with the needed information to support “foxhole to factory” was challenging and exciting. <br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>And how did you decide what technological means to communicate an idea or a directive, versus, say, meeting in-person? </strong></p>\n\n<p>I would say it depended on the idea. If it was personal, probably a phone call (one on one); if trying to generate support for an idea or transformational concept, meet in-person with my initiatives group to socialize the idea and get their input modifications and buy-in. Then Commanders conference to socialize idea with them, as they will have to implement it. Once socialized with leadership, we worldwide videoconference with the entire organization to define and describe the purpose, intent, how, and why &#8212; so everyone knew what we were trying to do and what their role was in execution. I found you cannot over-communicate when trying to make changes.<br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s an incredible accomplishment to become the first woman in U.S. Military history to achieve the four-star officer rank. Can you tell me about how things changed (or maybe still need to change further) in terms of your experience during your 37 years of service, and how you addressed diversity and inclusion in the military? </strong><br /><br /></p>\n\n<p>First, I certainly didn’t accomplish this by myself &#8212; I had a lot of help along the way! I joined the Army as part of the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) back in 1975. A few years later they disestablished the WAC and began the integration of women into the regular Army. This was the first time women had the opportunity to have the same career opportunities as their male counterparts in the branches now open to women. The challenge for the women who came into the Army back then was to force the integration &#8212; fight being put into traditional jobs like being a secretary, admin, clerk, or cook &#8212; and fight to be platoon leaders, etc., to support and move the integration of women into the regular Army.</p>\n\n<p>What I witnessed during my time in the Army was that the doors continued to open. Yes, there were roadblocks &#8212; but there were also many leaders along the way who were willing to help. I never worked for a woman. I worked for men who either believed in me or didn’t. My experience in my almost four decades was that the doors continued to open for women. I thought jumping out of airplanes was really neat &#8212; now my niece in the USAF is an A-10 fighter pilot, and we have women graduating from Ranger school!  <br /></p>\n\n<p>On diversity, I realized that being the only female in many forums, my voice was hard to be heard. And I also realized that most folks promoted and surrounded themselves with people in their own image. What my philosophy was &#8212; and I still think it is an issue today &#8212; is that diversity is not about numbers, it’s about getting the best and brightest from all walks of life, to help leaders solve the very complex issues that face us today. Don’t surround yourself with only people that think or act or look like you. <br /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who are the leaders that inspire you today? </strong></p>\n\n<p>I think we are products of our past &#8212; Mom and Dad, even though not here on earth, gave me the values that still guide me. Many of my military mentors, Gen. Hugh Shelton, Gen. Pete Schoomaker, Gen. Gordon Sullivan, Gen. Dick Cody, are still coaches and mentors to me today.  </p>\n\n<p>Folks I admire: Warren Buffett, only met him once but I like his concern for the betterment of our country; Oprah Winfrey, although I have never met her I admire her for what she does for our country how she presents herself and how she handles herself &#8212; awesome; Gen. Mattis &#8212; wow, I admire him for taking on this extremely tough assignment for the good of our country and our defense. Secretary Gates served two administrations, Republican and Democrat. <br /></p>\n\n<p>People that inspire me are people I believe are true leaders &#8212; valuing honesty and having the best interests of the country at heart. No hubris!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 19:54:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WPTavern: WP Engine Acquires StudioPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=81948\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-studiopress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4332:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.studiopress.com/\">StudioPress</a>, founded by Brian Gardner in 2007, has been acquired <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-acquires-studiopress/\">by managed WordPress hosting company WP Engine</a>, for an undisclosed amount. </p>\n\n<p>In 2007, Gardner created the Revolution theme which took the WordPress world by storm.

This framework would go on to power thousands of themes and be the cornerstone of StudioPress&#8217; theme business. In 2010, StudioPress <a href=\"https://www.studiopress.com/studiopress-merges-into-copyblogger-media-llc/\">was merged into Copyblogger Media LLC</a>, which eventually went on to create the Rainmaker platform. </p>\n\n<p>Fast forward to 2018 and StudioPress has been acquired by <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/\">WP Engine</a>, a managed WordPress hosting company founded in 2010 that earlier this year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/04/wp-engine-a-managed-wordpress-platform-raises-250m-from-silver-lake/\">received $250M in venture capital funding</a> from Silver Lake.  </p>\n\n<p>According to Jason Cohen, founder of WP Engine, this is the largest acquisition in the company&#8217;s history.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;In all, our contributions to the WordPress community in time, money, writing, coding and thought leadership totaled more than $1.7 million in 2017 and we’re already doing even more this year,&#8221; he said.<br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;As WP Engine continues to grow and scale, the way we give back to the WordPress community must grow and scale also, which was one of the deciding factors behind our acquisition of <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-acquires-studiopress/\">StudioPress</a>—our largest acquisition in WP Engine’s history.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The company plans to heavily invest in the Genesis Framework community and ecosystem by hiring people to work on different aspects of the framework. Support will receive a boost as well as the ecosystem surrounding StudioPress&#8217; products. </p>\n\n<p>With Gutenberg on the horizon, Cohen says the Genesis Framework will be a shining example of what&#8217;s possible with WordPress&#8217; new editor. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s been plenty of concern about how Gutenberg will affect existing plugins and themes, so Genesis can serve as an example for how Gutenberg can work brilliantly,&#8221; Cohen said. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;This directly advances the goals of WordPress Core. This precedent doesn’t stop with Gutenberg, either. Gutenberg is the transformation of today—there will be more tomorrow. While the topic of the day will change, the idea of supporting Core through themes and theme frameworks that support those efforts is an asset for the wider WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Gardner will stay on board and be part of StudioPress&#8217; leadership team at WP Engine with an emphasis on product development and community. Nathan Rice along with the support team will transition to WP Engine with Rice continuing to serve as the lead developer of Genesis. </p>\n\n<p>Gardner admits that the acquisition is bittersweet, but that it&#8217;s a founding moment in the company&#8217;s history.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;As my new colleague, Jason Cohen, the founder of WP Engine often says, &#8216;There are many founding moments in the history of a company.&#8217; This is one of those moments and I know it’s time for StudioPress to take the next step—and WP Engine is the right partner to take it with.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>StudioPress customers can expect better support, more themes to choose from, and little to no disruption of service.  </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 08:11:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: Free “JavaScript for WordPress Conference” to Stream Live Friday, June 29\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=81931\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://wptavern.com/free-javascript-for-wordpress-conference-to-stream-live-friday-june-29\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3834:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jsconf-2018.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>JavaScript for WordPress conference\n<p>Zac Gordon is hosting a &#8220;<a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript for WordPress Conference</a>&#8221; with two tracks on Friday, June 29, from 9:30 AM &#8211; 5:30 PM EDT. The free conference, sponsored by <a href=\"https://10up.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">10up</a> and <a href=\"https://wpbuffs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Buffs</a>, includes a full day of online talks from JavaScript professionals who work in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Gordon will be streaming the talks live via Crowdcast. Approximately 1,300 seats have been reserved so far, a number that rivals most WordCamps. Unlike WordCamps, however, the entire schedule is focused around developer education, featuring more technical talks that are often missing from traditional WordPress events.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/screely-1530150620973.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I figured there was an interest in more JS-specific WordPress content and, given my courses and getting to know some people working a lot with JavaScript, I figured I would give it a shot,&#8221; Gordon said.</p>\n<p>Gordon has been working for the past several years as a freelance educator after his former employer, Treehouse, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/treehouse-drops-support-for-wordpress-education\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dropped support for WordPress education</a>. He said his first project, the JavaScript for WordPress Master Course, was a huge undertaking. He is not offering that course anymore but is instead focusing on smaller, more targeted courses on his site <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">javascriptforwp.com</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of my courses this year will be Gutenberg related (have one now and a theme course launching next week, followed by an Advanced one after that),&#8221; Gordon said. He has also done courses at Udemy, Frontend Master, WP Sessions, WP101, and some consulting with Udacity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still learning the right price points and packaging and size,&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;A few companies have gotten group accounts for their teams which is really positive and encouraging for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gordon took a deep dive into JavaScript education after Matt Mullenweg issued a challenge to &#8220;Learn JavaScript Deeply&#8221; during his <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2015 State of the Word</a> address. He said so far the courses he offers have been going well and the community seems to have embraced the challenge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The funny thing about Learning JavaScript Deeply is that people will still be able to build things in Gutenberg and beyond without really knowing it deeply,&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;However most in the community have already picked up React or delved deeper into Vanilla JavaScript, and those who haven&#8217;t I believe certainly will be in the coming months and years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now with React in Core and the rebuilding of many parts of the admin with JS, we will have more real practical reasons to heed Matt&#8217;s call than we did before.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If the &#8220;JavaScript for WordPress Conference&#8221; goes well, Gordon said he hopes to make it an annual event. He is also considering doing a free day of workshops. All the talks given during the conference on Friday will be recorded and Gordon plans to drip them out over the coming months on his YouTube channel.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 02:49:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 3.1 Introduces Tips Interface to Guide New Users\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=81787\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-3-1-introduces-tips-interface-to-guide-new-users\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3663:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/06/21/whats-new-in-gutenberg-21st-june/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 3.1</a> added a tips interface that supports and guides new users who are learning to navigate the editor&#8217;s blocks and settings. The tips appear when a new user opens Gutenberg, highlighting useful items on the page.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/screely-1530113565627.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Although the tips may seem cluttered and intrusive to users who already know what they are doing, they are a necessary evil for introducing the UI to new users. Gutenberg is not yet intuitive enough to be able to stand on its own without explanation inside the interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2018/user-testing-gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">10up recently conducted Gutenberg usability tests</a> that unearthed some startling realities about how new users interact with the new editor. The tests were done on previous versions of the plugin (2.9.2) with users who frequently create content using the classic WordPress editor. 10up asked testers, who have had no training on Gutenberg, to write a news-style blog post.</p>\n<p>One of the most surprising results was that participants struggled with the simple task of adding an image to a post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Although the interface is clean, a lack of focused attention or hierarchy on the page became apparent,&#8221; 10up Experience Designer Sarah James said. &#8220;Participants struggled to complete tasks like adding an image that did not have a clearly exposed and labeled element like the title and paragraph fields. Heatmap tracking of the backend captured 734 unique clicks in the new post interface and only 40 of these clicks were on actual clickable elements. This suggests a struggle to find basic interactive elements, such as image blocks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Participants also had a difficult time finding and inserting additional block types &#8211; several testers overlooked the “+” symbol that triggers interface for adding a new block.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 3.0 and 3.1 have already improved on these pain points with changes that highlight common tasks. The 3.0 release <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/6636\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">redesigned the inserter, ditching tabs for collapsible panels</a>. This makes it more friendly for hunting among blocks. Version 3.1 includes a new design of the sibling inserter (the &#8220;+&#8221; symbol that appears to allow user to insert blocks between other blocks).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/screely-1530126900744.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In addition to improving usability issues with the inserter, Gutenberg 3.1 fixes some of the mechanics of previewing and saving posts. Users can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/7189\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">preview changes to a published post without updating the post</a>. The editor was also updated to trigger autosave as a standard save for a draft by the user currently authoring the post.</p>\n<p>HTML blocks that have been converted into shared blocks now show in preview mode, which makes it easier for users to see what they do and insert them visually. The code will only show if the user wants to edit the block.</p>\n<p>For a full list of the changes in 3.1, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/06/21/whats-new-in-gutenberg-21st-june/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">release post on make.wordpress.org</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:44:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"HeroPress: The Power Of WordCamps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2577\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"https://heropress.com/the-power-of-wordcamps/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-power-of-wordcamps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3085:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/062117-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I was helping hundreds of people that were using WordPress for their business.

Is this really the case, and where can we find the threshold for other states?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Does each state that wants to participate have to pass a law like South Dakota or is this now automatic for all states with a sales tax?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>WooCommerce has created <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2018/06/woocommerce-sales-tax-for-the-us-how-to-enable-automated-calculations-and-filing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a guide to help users set up and collect taxes</a> as required by the tax jurisdiction where their stores are located. Online store owners in the US and Canada can set enable automated tax calculations using either the WooCommerce Tax or TaxJar add-ons (both free), depending on whether the merchant operates within a single tax nexus or multiple nexus locations.</p>\n<p>Automatic sales tax calculations are also available for merchants using Easy Digital Downloads. Pippin Williamson built <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/edd-taxjar/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a free integration for EDD and TaxJar</a> that passes all tax rate determinations to TaxJar to calculate automatically, eliminating the need for manual tax rate entry.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling is very new and many state-specific details are yet to be worked out, but state legislatures are likely to be highly motivated and eager to rake in this new source of revenue. The <a href=\"https://blog.taxjar.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TaxJar blog</a> will be a good source for updates as more compliance information becomes available.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 21:26:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: Interview with Matías Ventura on Building the Vision for Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=81807\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/interview-with-matias-ventura-on-building-the-vision-for-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2952:\"<p>At WordCamp Europe I had the opportunity to sit down with <a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matías Ventura</a>, the technical lead for Gutenberg. Ventura, who has been responsible for building the vision for Gutenberg (in addition to building the actual product), shared a few things the team might have done differently in the earlier days to improve its reception in the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we should have put a little bit more effort into clarifying what we meant by the &#8216;editor,\'&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;When Matt announced that we&#8217;re going to be focusing on the editor, the WordPress community generally took it that we were going to focus on TinyMCE. But the idea from the start was to focus on the editing experience as a whole, how a user perceives that, which is the whole page. I think it took some time to rectify that that was always what was meant &#8211; to look at the whole editing interface at once.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With some of these projects people are going to be in different places at different times and things will coalesce and make sense at different paces. I think we&#8217;ve gotten to a point now where we have built enough of the Gutenberg vision that we can see where it can lead us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Several representatives from the Gutenberg team were available at WordCamp Europe for informal chats with the community. They also conducted workshops and gave presentations to prepare designers and developers for what&#8217;s coming in the next few months. Momentum for the new editor is building and Ventura shared what he hopes the world will see when version 1 is included in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The thing that has been the most fulfilling, at least to me, has been seeing the regular users when they can use Gutenberg and build things that would have been very hard for them to do before,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;When they share those impressions &#8211; that they can build something that they are proud of and express themselves &#8211; to me that is the most fulfilling because that&#8217;s really one of the major points behind this. At the same time, I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing what the design and developer community can build with it and where their imaginations can take us from there. Core is going to supply the infrastructure and the main building blocks but it&#8217;s everything that can be built around it that&#8217;s going to be exciting, as always with WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ventura also described some of the interesting possibilities of templates, nested blocks, and child blocks, and how they can be combined to create more sophisticated solutions. He recommends the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org/Gutenberg</a> page for resources on getting started with the new editor.

Gutenberg&#8217;s timeline is one of the most pressing questions for those who work in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team has sustained a rapid pace of development over the past year with 30 releases since development began. There are currently 14,000 sites actively using the plugin and Mullenweg plans to roll it out to WordPress.com users in the near future. He announced that the WordPress 5.0 release could be ready as soon as August. In the meantime, the Gutenberg team will continue to refine its current features according to the roadmap Mullenweg outlined in his keynote:</p>\n<p><strong>June 2018</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Freeze new features into Gutenberg</li>\n<li>Hosts, agencies and teachers invited to opt-in sites they have influence over</li>\n<li>Opt-in for wp-admin users on WP.com</li>\n<li>Mobile App support in the Aztec editor across iOs and Android</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>July 2018</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.9.x release with a strong invitation to install either Gutenberg or Classic Editor plugin</li>\n<li>Opt-out for wp-admin users on WP.com</li>\n<li>Heavy triage and bug gardening, getting blockers to zero</li>\n<li>Explore expanding Gutenberg beyond the post into site customization</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>August 2018 and beyond</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All critical issues resolved</li>\n<li>Integration with Calypso, offering opt-in users</li>\n<li>100k+ sites having makde 250k+ post using Gutenberg</li>\n<li>Core merge, beginning the 5.0 release cycle</li>\n<li>5.0 beta releases and translations completed</li>\n<li>Mobile version of Gutenberg by the end of the year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mullenweg said he hopes to increase Gutenberg usage to 100,000 sites with 250,000 posts made over the next few months. WordPress.com will be instrumental in that goal with a call to action for opt-in that will appear on several hundred thousand sites. In July, WordPress.com will switch the Gutenberg editor to opt-out. Mullenweg said he hopes to gather data from how users respond, especially those who have third-party plugins active on their sites.</p>\n<p>Switching between editing posts in the mobile apps currently breaks but Mullenweg anticipates this will be resolved by August, with full mobile versions of Gutenberg available by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg opened his keynote by drawing attendees&#8217; attention to a new &#8220;<a href=\"https://publiccode.eu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Public Code</a>&#8221; link in the footer of WordPress.org. This campaign, organized by <a href=\"https://fsfe.org/index.en.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>, aims to require any publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made available under a Free and Open Source Software license.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg also announced St. Louis, MO, as the next location for WordCamp US in 2019-2020. The local WordPress community in the city spans two states with members from both Missouri and Illinois who have hosted seven WordCamps since 2011.</p>\n<h3>Developers and Agencies Double Down on Gutenberg Preparation, &#8220;Playing for Keeps&#8221;</h3>\n<p>The process of getting products and client websites ready for Gutenberg is a leap for nearly every company and freelancer invested in the WordPress ecosystem. Mullenweg said he cannot guarantee a specific date for release but thinks that &#8220;5.0 is going be ready within a relatively short time frame.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although many WCEU attendees expressed skepticism about the accelerated timeline for Gutenberg&#8217;s inclusion in core, most recognize the importance of working towards making their clients and products compatible with the new editor.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg technical lead <a href=\"https://matiasventura.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matias Ventura</a> said it&#8217;s too early to tell whether the WordPress community will be ready by the time Gutenberg is included in core. &#8220;I think people have already been trying to get ready and we&#8217;re already seeing many major sites being launched using Gutenberg,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;From what we&#8217;ve seen with plugin authors building compatibility for Gutenberg, it seems there&#8217;s already enough momentum going on that it could be achievable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brad Williams, CEO of WebDevStudios, said his company&#8217;s team of engineers has been <a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/2018/03/20/webdevstudios-gutenberg-planning-wordpress/\">actively preparing for Gutenberg</a> since late last year and is &#8220;very excited about what it means for the future of WordPress publishing.&#8221; Williams assigned two Gutenberg Leads internally to head up everything related to the new editor and conducted internal training with staff. WebDevStudios also built and released its own Gutenberg add-on framework called <a href=\"https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-Blocks/releases\">WDS Blocks</a>, a framework that includes new custom blocks that many WDS clients use.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having a potential release date, even if it’s only a target month, is incredibly helpful,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;This gives us a goal to work towards with each of our clients to verify we are ready for the release. I expect the majority of our clients will not enable Gutenberg on release, but we still need to make sure we have an upgrade plan ready for WordPress 5.0. We are working closely with each of our clients so they understand what is coming, the benefits Gutenberg can provide them, and what a potential roll-out plan will look like. We are also making sure any new leads coming in the door are aware of Gutenberg and the impact it will have on their new WordPress project.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gary Jones, plugin developer and WordPress engineer at <a href=\"https://gamajo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gamajo</a>, expressed apprehension about the timeline. He also plans to make use of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> plugin to opt sites out of using Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With 737 open issues, I think the August timeline may still be a little short,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;That&#8217;s only for the &#8216;critical issues&#8217; to be resolved but introducing such a massive change to the basics of managing content like this needs more than just the critical issues resolved; it needs all of the workflow to be very smooth as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jones said he doesn&#8217;t think the typical rhetoric of getting a &#8216;1.0&#8217; release out the door applies in the case of Gutenberg. &#8220;There&#8217;s too much riding on it for it not to make a great first impression for the user base who haven&#8217;t been following its progress,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;A plugin can have a much quicker release turnaround time for non-critical improvements and fixes than what WP core would have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jones said he plans to wait until the merge proposal before tackling plugin compatibility and will wait until 5.0 is out to start improving the experience for his clients. He said this may require creating custom blocks or installing plugins that add custom blocks clients might need. &#8220;By then we&#8217;d also know how ACF, Pods. and other plugins we use, and the Genesis theme, are supporting Gutenberg editor (or not),&#8221; Jones said.</p>\n<p>Jake Goldman, President and founder of <a href=\"https://10up.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">10up</a>, said his company already has an internal mandate that all new public plugins and major plugin updates must have at least &#8220;beta&#8221; support for Gutenberg. 10up&#8217;s <a href=\"https://distributorplugin.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Distributor</a> product is already Gutenberg-ready and the company has several Gutenberg-ready plugins and updates expected to ship in the next 1-2 months.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Clients are trickier,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;We have two big client projects started in the last couple of months that are using Gutenberg, and some pretty complicated custom blocks and extensions. We have a couple of other customers who are curious or in the exploratory phase. Two big client projects have us a bit gun shy about adopting [Gutenberg] as the &#8216;standard&#8217; on newer projects until it matures a bit more and begins to focus a bit more on the &#8216;enterprise use case / user stories&#8217; &#8211; there are some real challenges with those user stories.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Goldman also said he was encouraged to hear that Calypso will adopt Gutenberg in the next couple of months, because he hopes it will address some of the confusion and fragmentation issues.</p>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t anticipate Gutenberg actually landing in August, however. &#8220;I don’t see August, frankly, because I don’t think the core team has a clear vision for &#8216;how&#8217; an upgrade with Gutenberg will work,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;That said, I suspect Matt is knowingly putting timeline pressure on the team &#8211; a bit of &#8216;if I say August, we can probably hit November&#8217; type mentality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mason James, founder of <a href=\"https://www.valet.io/\">Valet</a>, said he is confident his clients and products will be ready after testing Gutenberg on hundreds of sites. His team is watching a few products that have compatibility issues but he is hopeful these will be resolved soon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The timeline of August seems a bit optimistic,&#8221; James said. &#8220;I’d be surprised if that is met, but our clients will be in good shape if that happens. We’ve also been sending information to our clients via email, a whitepaper, to try to mitigate any surprises ahead of time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We decided last year that Gutenberg was a tremendous opportunity for us to reinforce our value proposition to our clients,&#8221; James said. &#8220;It’s an ongoing important initiative for us this year; We&#8217;re playing for keeps.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thefearlessfreelancer.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Carrie Dils</a>, a WordPress developer, consultant, and educator, has also jumped head first into getting her products compatible with Gutenberg ahead of the new timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m feverishly working to get an updated version of the <a href=\"https://store.carriedils.com/downloads/utility-pro/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Utility Pro theme</a> (my primary product) out the door,&#8221; Dils said. &#8220;The Gutenberg updates are just one part of a larger overhaul (including a minimum requirement of PHP7 and WP 5.0+). I’ve also made the decision not to incorporate Classic Editor theme styles. All looking forward, no looking back.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 16:37:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"Matt: WordPress in Uber\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48160\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://ma.tt/2018/06/wordpress-in-uber/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:923:\"<p>I really love this thread and the replies sharing stories about Val Vesa&#8217;s experience talking about WordPress in an Uber / Lyft ride:</p>\n\n\n	<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Uber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Uber</a> driver last night, going home from airport asked me where was I coming from.<br />Told here about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a><br />&#8211; what is that, she asked.<br />&#8211; the European Conference for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a>, I said.<br />Her eyes sparkling, she grabbed the wheel firm, looked in the rear view mirror at me and said,</p>&mdash; Val Vesa | Social Media &amp; Travel Photography (@adspedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adspedia/status/1008782561638801413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 18, 2018</a></blockquote>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 21 Jun 2018 05:20:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 321 – Recap of WordCamp EU 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=81758&preview=true&preview_id=81758\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-321-recap-of-wordcamp-eu-2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1901:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://lanche86.com/\">Milan Ivanović</a> who helped organize WordCamp EU in Belgrade, Serbia this past weekend. Ivanović describes what it was like to organize such a large event, challenges the team overcame, and a few details related to WordCamp EU 2019 that will be held in Berlin, Germany.

ScoutDocs is a WordPress plugin that adds simple file-sharing to your WordPress site.</em></p>\n<p>Coding in React involves JSX, a bizarre-but-wonderful XML syntax that you dump directly into the middle of your JavaScript code. It feels exquisitely wrong. Browsers agree, so your JSX-containing JS code will have to be transpiled to regular JavaScript. This can involve using a complex maze of tools. Babel, NPM, Webpack, Browserify, Gulp, Grunt, Uglify, Uglifyify (yes, you read that right), and more. You have decisions to make, and you will find fierce advocates for various solutions.</p>\n<p>For ScoutDocs, I decided to go with <a href=\"https://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a> for task running, because I was already comfortable with it, and I needed it for <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-wp-deployhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-wp-deploy\">grunt-wp-deploy</a>. <b>Use a task runner you are already comfortable with.</b> Even if it is just NPM scripts. You’re learning a lot of new things already. It’s okay to keep your task runner setup.</p>\n<p>Next, I had to choose a JS bundler which would let me write and use modular code that gets pulled together into a browser-executable bundle. After deliberating between <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org\">Webpack</a> and <a href=\"http://browserify.org/\">Browserify</a>, I chose Browserify. <b>Webpack is really complicated.</b> It is also very powerful. I recommend you avoid it until you need it. I haven’t needed it yet, and found Browserify to be easier to configure and use, even though it’s a bit on the slow side.</p>\n<p>As I was building ScoutDocs and tweaking my dev tools, tweaking my Grunt file, and writing code to search/replace strings etc, I began to feel like the time I was spending too much time on tooling. Was I becoming one of those people who spend all their time listening to productivity podcasts instead of… being productive? I can see how someone could get sucked into that trap, but putting a reasonable amount of time into configuring your development tools can pay dividends for you beyond simply the time saved. It can also prevent mistakes, keep you in coding mode more often, and increasing your confidence in your code builds. <b>Spend the time up front to make your tools work for you.</b></p>\n<p>Other posts in this series:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/lessons-learned-making-scoutdocs-outsourcing/\">Outsourcing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2018/06/11/making-scoutdocs-react\">React</a></li>\n<li>WordPress Rest API</li>\n<li>PHP 7</li>\n<li>Build tools</li>\n<li>Unit testing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 17:59:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mark Jaquith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: WP Rig – A WordPress Starter Theme and Build Process in One\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=81618\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-rig-a-wordpress-starter-theme-and-build-process-in-one\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3750:\"<p><a href=\"http://mor10.com/\">Morten Rand-Hendricksen</a>, Senior Staff Instructor at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/\">LinkedIn Learning</a>, has released <a href=\"https://wprig.io/\">WP Rig</a>. WP Rig is a WordPress starter theme and build process combined into one. The starter theme provides a minimal set of templates with the ability to drag-and-drop files from the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/\">WordPress template hierarchy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It contains a heavily optimized code and file structure, support for lazy-loading images, and documented helper functions. The build process requires no configuration and provides a modern foundation to develop on top of. </p>\n\n<p>Although WP Rig ships with a starter theme, the build process works with any theme you choose to use. WP Rig uses <a href=\"https://gulpjs.com/\">Gulp</a> to manage and optimize files, <a href=\"https://browsersync.io/\">BrowserSync</a> to immediately preview from inside the browser, and ES2015 to parse JavaScript. <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/postcss/postcss\">PostCSS</a>, and <a href=\"http://cssnext.io/\">CSSNext</a> is used to parse CSS. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">WordPress Coding Standards</a> and <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> are used to check code quality. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VS Code</a> is tightly integrated with WP Rig but developers can use any code editor they choose. </p>\n\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen says the goal of the project is to provide a starting point where developers can write accessible and performant code from the start using best practices. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress and the web it lives on has evolved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So have the tools we use to build experiences and interactions on and with the web. WordPress theme development is no longer &#8216;just&#8217; about writing PHP and CSS and JavaScript. </p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s also about accessibility and build processes and coding standards and performance best practices and and modern coding languages and browser support and a myriad of other topics.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;WP Rig bridges this gap by building accessibility, performance, coding standards, and modern coding best practices in by default.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>LinkedIn Learning donated Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s time to WP Rig. In collaboration with <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a>, <a href=\"https://medinathoughts.com/2018/05/17/progressive-wordpress/\">Google</a>, and other members of the WordPress community, it was released as an open source project that is maintained by him and <a href=\"https://github.com/bamadesigner\">Rachel Cherry</a>. <br /></p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It is not owned or branded by any company, nor beholden to a company goal or ideology,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The purpose and goal of WP Rig is to provide the WordPress community with a theme development rig that puts accessibility, performance, and modern best practices in the front seat to the benefit of the end-user and the web as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>You can download WP Rig for free <a href=\"https://wprig.io\">from the project&#8217;s site</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/wprig/wprig/\">on GitHub</a>. To learn how to use it, LinkedIn Learning is offering a free course entitled &#8220;<a href=\"https://wprig.io/learn/\">Build WordPress Themes with WP Rig</a>.&#8221; The course covers a myriad of topics including, configuring the VS Code workpace settings, Templates, and AMP integration. </p>\n\n<p>For more information about WP Rig check out the <a href=\"https://wprig.io/introducing-wprig-wordpress/\">project&#8217;s official announcement</a>. <br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 01:19:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe 2018 Contributor Day Posts Record Turnout Amid Wi-Fi Outage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=81514\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2018-contributor-day-posts-record-turnout-amid-wi-fi-outage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7440:\"<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wceu-2018-contributor-day.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe hosted a successful contributor day in Belgrade despite a wi-fi outage during the first half of the day.

The first question they addressed is the one everyone is asking: When will Gutenberg land in core?</p>\n<p>The team said the editor is pretty close to feature complete and should achieve that in the next few months when version 3.3 is released. At that point the focus will be on refining the current experience. They estimate this to happen in June or the first week of July but also hinted at more information coming in Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s keynote address this afternoon.</p>\n<p>Developers also asked about the criteria that will be used to decide that Gutenberg is ready for a WordPress release. The project has a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4894\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">scope and features MVP issue on GitHub</a> that provides an overview for the major functionality that will be introduced in the first version of the new editor. It shows which features have already been shipped and which ones are remaining.</p>\n<p>The team explained that many of the final features have come from developer and user feedback. Some features were not necessarily planned for V1, but it became more apparent that these were needed because they improved either the developer or user experience. For example, within the past four or five months the team found that the child blocks would be necessary to allow developers to be more expressive in extending the editor. A few of the remaining issues include inline images and post locking for concurrent users, but the team doesn&#8217;t anticipate any major new features on the horizon before V1 is released.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineers also assured workshop attendees that the project is being built with backwards compatibility in mind. One person asked what will happen when the 5.0 release lands. The team explained that the Gutenberg update will not change all the content on WordPress sites. When users open a post in the editor they will have the option to convert that content to block format so it will work with the new editor. If it doesn&#8217;t quite work, users be able to fall back to the classic editor.</p>\n<p>The team said they took great lengths not to alter how WordPress deals with data. Gutenberg does not change the content structure. One of the cornerstones for the project is providing an update that will not fragment the content structure. There will be a lot of resources available ahead of the release for helping everyone move forward together.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineers said they are working to be conscious not to delay the project, because the longer the delay, the more potential users WordPress is losing because the software is not easy enough for them to build and customize content and websites.</p>\n<h3>How Will Theme Building Change with Gutenberg?</h3>\n<p>Gutenberg designers and engineers also tackled questions about how the new editor will change the theme building experience. Design lead Tammie Lister emphasized the importance of theme developers first getting better at creating themes that do not try to do everything. The basic purpose of a theme is to style the frontend and provide an editor style. One potential way forward for theme developers is to provide additional features by releasing a suite of blocks via a plugin. Lister said she hopes that themes will become a lot lighter in the Gutenberg era and encouraged developers to utilize style guides.</p>\n<p>The team also said that existing themes will continue to function and redesigning a theming API, without the hassle of editing a bunch of PHP files, may be possible in the future. However, it&#8217;s too early to know what that will look like. For now, the rendering engine is not changing. Theme developers interested in Gutenberg compatibility should start looking towards deconstructing their themes into individual elements and learn how to express a theme as a list of blocks.</p>\n<h3>How Will Gutenberg Handle Customization?</h3>\n<p>Attendees asked several questions regarding the specific plan to implement customization, or live previewing, after Gutenberg is in core. The current phase 1 handles content editing and puts the infrastructure in place to support customization. There are some issues on GitHub for transforming widgets into blocks, which will be a step towards the site building experience. The team has already implemented direct manipulation on the WYSIWYG road but phase 2 will cover more aspects of customization.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg is not ready to replace the Customizer anytime soon, but the next phase will explore what a block-based experience of customization will look like. When asked if Gutenberg will &#8220;kill off some of the page builders,&#8221; the team said the goal is for page building type applications to be able to use Gutenberg as a springboard for different implementations that extend the editor in ways that benefit different types of users.</p>\n<p>An attendee asked how the team plans to enhance adoption once Gutenberg lands in core. The team said they are working on an experimental feature called &#8216;tips&#8217; that offers a story walkthrough of the publishing workflow. It includes helpful nudges to assist users in getting better at navigating the interface. The wider ecosystem has already responded with courses and tutorials to help developers get on board. The WordPress training team is also working on some training materials to use at WordCamps with tutorials for developers to learn how to convert existing plugins and themes to be Gutenberg-ready.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 Jun 2018 11:18:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 320 – Building a Sustainable Web\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=81508&preview=true&preview_id=81508\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-320-building-a-sustainable-web\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1741:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by Jack Lenox, Software Engineer at Automattic, to discuss his new project, <a href=\"https://sustywp.com/\">SustyWP</a>.

It was at the speaker dinner, and he sat across from me for a while. He seemed like a pretty normal WordPress developer and several weeks later I asked him to do a HeroPress essay. His answer surprised me. &#8220;Well sure, that sounds pretty cool, aside from the fact that I don&#8217;t really do WordPress anymore&#8221;.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, he had mostly retired from active WordPress development. His every day world was now filled with working in different frameworks and languages, amongst people who help WordPress in disdain. But Ed&#8217;s view fascinated me. For all that he was working with more modern frameworks, WordPress is what made him a great developer. The empathy and compassion for the user that WordPress holds so dearly carried over into the rest of his life.</p>\n<p>So what was he doing at WordCamp? Spreading the word about his cool new organization, which I will leave for you to read about.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-taught-better-developer/\">How WordPress Taught Me To Be a Better Developer</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: By Helping Others, I Save Myself\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=By%20Helping%20Others%2C%20I%20Save%20Myself&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fby-helping-others-i-save-myself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: By Helping Others, I Save Myself\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fby-helping-others-i-save-myself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fby-helping-others-i-save-myself%2F&title=By+Helping+Others%2C+I+Save+Myself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: By Helping Others, I Save Myself\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/by-helping-others-i-save-myself/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/osmi-150x150.png&description=By Helping Others, I Save Myself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: By Helping Others, I Save Myself\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/by-helping-others-i-save-myself/\" title=\"By Helping Others, I Save Myself\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/by-helping-others-i-save-myself/\">By Helping Others, I Save Myself</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:14:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: Plugin Detective Wins WordCamp Orange County’s 2018 Plugin-a-Palooza\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=81315\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"https://wptavern.com/plugin-detective-wins-wordcamp-orange-county-2018-plugin-a-palooza\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3482:\"<p><a href=\"https://2018.oc.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Orange County</a>, CA, took place this past weekend and the winners of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-orange-county-plugin-a-palooza-first-place-prize-is-3000\">Plugin-a-Palooza</a> have been crowned. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/croixhaug\">Nathan Tyler</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nataliemac\">Natalie MacLees</a> took the first place prize of $3,000 with their submission, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-detective/\">Plugin Detective</a>.</p>\n\n<img />\n	Creating a new case in Plugin Detective\n\n\n<p>When it comes to troubleshooting WordPress, disabling and re-enabling plugins is one of the first steps in the process. This is time consuming and involves browsing to the plugin management page multiple times to turn a plugin on or off.</p>\n\n<p>Plugin Detective simplifies the process by quickly identifying the culprit. Once installed, a Troubleshooting quick link is added to the WordPress Toolbar. From here, users can open or continue a case. When a case is opened, a bot named Detective Otto asks users to navigate to the page where the problem is occurring.</p>\n\n<p>After the location is identified, users inform Detective Otto which plugins are required for the site to function properly. Interrogations is the act of of disabling and enabling plugins. Multiple interrogation attempts are made until the culprit is identified through the process of elimination. The following video does a great job of explaining and showing how it works. <br /></p>\n\n\n	<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"></div>\n\n\n<p>It can also be used to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-detective/#i%20just%20see%20errors%20or%20a%20white%20screen.%20can%20i%20still%20use%20plugin%20detective%20to%20troubleshoot%20what%E2%80%99s%20gone%20wrong%3F\">identify and fix</a> White Screen of Death errors caused by plugins.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Plugin Detective is partly inspired by a software program from the 90s called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_Catcher\">Conflict Catcher</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I used &#8216;Conflict Catcher&#8217; to troubleshoot conflicts between system extensions on my Mac,&#8221; Tyler said. &#8220;I thought the concept was cool and would often run it for fun to try to figure out how it worked. Eventually, I learned that the computer science concept is a &#8216;binary search.&#8217;</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Applying the concept to WordPress plugins seemed like a good approach to the plugin conflict problem we all experience.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Tyler developed the functionality and MacLees is credited with the plugin&#8217;s design, user experience, JavaScript, API calls, etc. The duo plan to establish relationships with plugin authors to help get them better bug reports. <br />><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&#8220;Basically, if an author opts-in, we can help the end-user file a support ticket right there in Plugin Detective after we&#8217;ve identified the problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The support team gets a helpful bug report with notes from the customer, along with system information, other installed plugins, active theme, etc.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>If you troubleshoot sites often or want an easier way to figure out which plugin is causing a conflict, consider adding Plugin Detective to your toolkit. Plugin Detective is free and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-detective/\">available for download</a> from the WordPress plugin directory. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Jun 2018 02:12:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Other Cultures\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48139\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://ma.tt/2018/06/other-cultures/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:311:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n	<p>As the traveller who has once been from home is wiser than he who has never left his own doorstep, so a knowledge of one other culture should sharpen our ability to scrutinize more steadily, to appreciate more lovingly, our own.</p><cite>Margaret Mead</cite></blockquote>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 23:35:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 03:29:19 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Sun, 15 Jul 2018 03:15:27 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130910210210\";}','no'),(128,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1531668560','no'),(129,'_transient_feed_mod_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1531625360','no'),(130,'_transient_timeout_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','1531668560','no'),(131,'_transient_dash_v2_88ae138922fe95674369b1cb3d215a2b','<div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wordpress.org/news/2018/07/update-on-gutenberg/\'>Update on Gutenberg</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2018-draws-2085-attendees-organizers-look-ahead-to-2019-in-berlin\'>WPTavern: WordCamp Europe 2018 Draws 2,085 Attendees, Organizers Look Ahead to 2019 in Berlin</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/array-launches-free-gutenberg-ready-atomic-blocks-theme-on-wordpress-org\'>WPTavern: Array Launches Free Gutenberg-Ready Atomic Blocks Theme on WordPress.org</a></li><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-323-recap-of-wordcamp-grand-rapids-and-a-gutenberg-road-map\'>WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 323 – Recap of WordCamp Grand Rapids and A Gutenberg Road Map</a></li></ul></div>','no'),(132,'theme_mods_twentyseventeen','a:1:{s:18:\"custom_css_post_id\";i:-1;}','yes'),(133,'_transient_is_multi_author','0','yes'),(134,'_transient_twentyseventeen_categories','1','yes'),(135,'_transient_timeout_plugin_slugs','1531711792','no'),(136,'_transient_plugin_slugs','a:2:{i:0;s:19:\"akismet/akismet.php\";i:1;s:9:\"hello.php\";}','no'),(137,'recently_activated','a:0:{}','yes');
