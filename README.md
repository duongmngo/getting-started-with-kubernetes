## Objective
- Kubernetes overview
- Know to step by step master K8s and ignore unnecessary parts when getting started with Kubernetes
- Use Kubernetes to make a real-world (WordPress) application scalable and auto scaling
## Prior knowledge:
- What is container, VM?
    - Basically, containers and VM are similar in their goals. They support to isolate an application into a container unit and run it, re-use it everywhere. Container and VM support simulating a computer with installed softwares, applications.
    - The main difference between container and VMs is in their architectural approach.
    - reference: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b    
- What is a orchestration platform? 
    - List a few container orchestrators platform: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesospher,...
## Kubernetes Overview:
- Kubernetes: What and Why
- Kubernetes cluster
    - What is Kubernetes cluster?
    - List some kind of Kubernetes Cluster.
        - Google Kubernetes Engine.
    - Set up Kubernetes Cluster on local using minikube (Single node cluster)
    - Setup minikube: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube        
        - Follow the guide to install minikube, I will also install kubectl in your CLI.
        - kubectl support to interact with Kubernetes cluster. You can work with multiple Kubernetes cluster and switch the current context (current kubernetes cluster)
- Kubernetes node architecture

    - Master-Node communication    
        - Cluster --> Master
        - Master -> Cluster
            - apiserver -> kubelet
            - apiserver -> nodes, pods, and services
    - Overview how it works from: Kubectl -> API Server --> (Backend process: Ectd + Scheduler + Controller) --> Kubelet
    - What is Kubernetes API Object? What is the format? How Kubectl sends it to API Server?
- Pods.
    - Introduction
        - Pod is the basic buiding block of Kubernetes - The smallest and simplest unit in the kubernetes object.
        - Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes.
        - Pod encapsulates application containers.
        - We will rarely create individual pods directly in Kubernetes. Because Pods is ephemeral, so we often use some kind of Pod Controller (Higher-level abtraction) to manage Pods.
        - Some kind of Pods Controller: Deployment, Statefulset, DaemonSet
    - Example without demo
- Deployment
    - Introduction
        - Reason we need ReplicaSet, Replication Controller, Development.
            - Don't need to use ReplicaSet, Replication Controller now. Forget them and go ahead to use Deployment
            - Replication Controller --- Next Generation ---> ReplicaSet ---> Development (higher-level concept that manage ReplicaSet)       
    - Example with demo
- Some special Controllers: 
    - StatefulSets        
        -  If an application doesnâ€™t require any stable identifiers or ordered deployment, deletion, or scaling, you should deploy your application with a controller that provides a set of stateless replicas.
    - DaemonSet
        - Brief when we use it: DaemonSet ensures that all Node run a copy of a Pod.        
- Service 
    -  Introduction
    -  Example
    -  Demo apply Service API object
-  Service Discovery - DNS
    -   Introduction
    -   Demo
-  Storage
    - On-disk files in a Container are ephemeral
    - When a Container crashes, kubelet will restart it, but the files will be lost
    - When running Containers together in a Pod it is often necessary to share files between those Containers
    - It will be solved by PersistentVolume, PersistenVolumeClaim
    - Kubernetes supports several types of Volumes:
        - awsElasticBlockStore
        - gcePersistentDisk
        - azureDisk      
        - persistentVolumeClaim
        - ...
    - PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim provides an API for users and administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed
- Auto Scaling
    - Container resource request and limit
    - Example 
- Network
    - ClusterIp, NodePort, LoadBalancer
- How K8s integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- After all, keep researching below topics:
    -   helm
    -   Google Kubernetes Engine
    -   etcd
