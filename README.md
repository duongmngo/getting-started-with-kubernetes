## Objective
- Kubernetes overview
- Know to step by step master K8s and ignore unnecessary parts when getting started with Kubernetes
- Use Kubernetes to make a real-world (WordPress) application scalable and auto scaling
## Prior knowledge:
- What is container, VM?
    - Basically, containers and VM are similar in their goals. They support to isolate an application into a container unit and run it, re-use it everywhere. Container and VM support simulate the physical hardware.
    - The main difference between container and VMs is in their architectural approach.

- What is a orchestration platform? 
    - List a few container orchestrators platform: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesospher,...
## Kubernetes Overview:
